  <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>
  <h4>March 26, 2015</h4>

    My pairing experiences so far have been very good overall. It is definitely fun to see how each person tries to solve a problem or implement their own style of code.  By combining with others and instructors on guided pairing sessions many ideas come together and everyone can collaborate on one issue.  I feel like I have learned from others and others have learned from me.  Each person brings something different to the table.  Some people are better at the actual understanding of the technology and language while others are better at organizing and breaking down a problem.  I have had some points where I felt lost and my partner just keeps my head level and shows me where I went wrong.  For example CSS is a lot of trial and error and can drive you nuts, but when you have someone working with you who is very calm and easy going, you tend to be more relaxed and ok with making mistakes.  From my experience we are all in the same boat and many of us are brand new to these programs and quick style of learning.  We all have our strengths and weaknesses that we can share with each other which in turn can help all of us.  I have learned from other peoples' advice and practices so pairing has been a good experience so far.

    Getting feedback is a good way for me to see where I can improve and at the same time let me know what I am doing well at.  I like the constructive criticism, although I sometimes find it hard to give to others, because it is a direct, but good way of letting me know what I need to be better at.  The feedback I have recieved so far has definitely helped me and it is also nice to hear someone tell you that you know what you are doing.  It gives me a little more confidence in myself that I can understand the programs and challenges.  Using feedback and pairing combined forces people to work together which is good because you work with multiple people everyday in the real world and everyone has different  ways and methods of accomplishing goals and everyday tasks.  Using this combination in a learning environment helps as well because it is important to ask for help and hear other peoples' opinion.  Many times you learn from other people. It is hard to do everything by yourself and that is why working with others, especially on programming, is beneficial.  You become much more open minded and are willing to listen to outside advice.  So overall this system definitely lets me know how and where I can improve my skills and put them into use.
