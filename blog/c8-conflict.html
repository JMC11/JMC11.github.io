  <h1>Conflicts</h1>

    A little while back me and a friend of mine had a bit of an altercation.  We both had a lot going on at the time personally and on top of that we each had a couple drinks that night.  There was really no main topic the fight was about.  Essentially I think we both had so much built up anger we sort of lashed out at each other.  We had a short shouting match back and forth and got a little tangled up, but nothing serious.  I eventually walked away as we both probably needed to.  The main emotion going through it was anger, but I also felt bad considering he was my best friend.
  </p>
    About 15 minutes later we met up and sat down and apologized.  Things happen, especially among friends.  Mainly we resolved the argument just using reason.  After both of us were able to cool down, it was a lot easier dealing with the situation.  If I were to go back, and my friend would probably say the same, I would have kept my cool better and not let my anger get the best of me.  That is what led both of us over the edge.  I usually am able to contain myself.  Having a couple drinks that night also probably did not help us.  Overall, I learned that conflicts will occur in your life. There is no such thing as a perfect life.  Conflicts and issues are part of it and how you handle and react to them is the most important.  Some conflicts can be avoided though and by following your own set of "best practices" you can probably stay away from a few.
