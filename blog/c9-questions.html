  <h1>The Right Questions</h1>
  <h4>April 21, 2015</h4>

    In order to discover an answer to a question, one must first actually present a question that makes sense.  Many times, especially in the world of programming, people ask unspecific and jumbled questions that are hard for the answerer to interpret.  I have seen through my Google+ community good questions and bad.  I personally have not asked too many questions in this community, but can easily tell when I see a confusing question.  There are some guidelines you should follow before asking a question in order to make it the right one.

    First you probably want to do some research on your issue.  Take some time to educate yourself with what you are asking.  When you present your question to peers, staff, whoever, makes sure you are specific.  You will want to include example code, what is failing, what you are trying to accomplish, etc.  With this information, it is much easier for someone to grasp what you are attempting to get an answer for.  There is a bit of an order you should follow with all this.  Mainly do research first, then explain the problem followed by the example code.  Always proofread your questions before finalizing them.  Make sense of it.  Flip the question on yourself and see if it is easy to understand and readable.  By following all these guidelines, you find out sooner than later how easy it is to ask great questions and get the answers you want.  Over time you will become a pro at it.
