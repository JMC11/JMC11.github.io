      Version control allows users to track changes made to a file within a project.  Not only can you track your own files, but multiple people can keep track of the same files.  It allows people such as developers to track changes to code as well as fall back to a working code set if they run into problems.  People can go back to older "checkpoints" per say to add new files, fix bugs, etc.  Version control is also beneficial in the way that it helps organize workflow, especially when numerous people are working on the same program or project.  Without something such as version work may become jumbled and mistakes could be made for example someone may delete another's previous work.  So essentially version control is a great organizational tool that allows users to have work to fall back on and helps promote a more dynamic work environment which is quickly the norm in today's world.

      Git keeps track of your changes known as "commits" exactly how you made them.  For instance if you made on a line of code in a file such as just adding some text and then made a commit afterwards that removed that text, you can still go back to the file version with the original text you added.  So to put it simply Git tracks all your changes in an organized fashion and allows you to make as many different modifications as necessary throughout a project.  Git also helps track these commits with the "git log" command which then shows all the changes made, when they happened, and by whom.

      GitHub is a good place to store code because it allows people like programmers to have a central main source where everyones' code can be accessed. It lets multiple people working on the same project obtain each others code, make changes to it, or even make suggestions to the original developer to make it run smoother.  GitHub is also great because it allows everyone to access the same information anytime from any computer.  You do not have to exchange between to machines.  Rather you can put all your code into the GitHub website repository and pull it from there to your own computer.
