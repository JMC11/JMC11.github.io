  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h4>March 31, 2015</h4>

<section>
  <p>
    Stereotype threat is the idea that people feel at risk because of negative steroetypes about the social group they come from.  Studies have shown that this leads to underperformance for these groups of people whether it is in the work environment or school.  It is said this term hinders the actual potential of minority groups and women.  I really have never had any encounter with this nor have I ever seen it effect another person and I went to UCONN, a public university with 20,000 students and numerous different groups of people, for four years.  I personally do not really agree with stereotype threats and here is why.

    There may be some truth to this idea in certain manners, but overall everyone always has to make issues about race.  Is there racism and stereotypes that still exist today?  Unfortunately yes there is, but society takes time to undergo changes especially on such a global level.  The reason I disagree with stereotype threat is that they say it effects performance of African American students as well as other minority groups.  Honestly even if there are studies that show this how does it make sense?  In my opinion if someone is not doing well in school or work, it is not because of race.  It is up to the individual to be the best they can be or live up to their potential.  Stereotype threat is just another typical way this country brings race into the picture.  If America is so fixed on getting rid of any sort of stereotypes, then why is it a recurring issue in every aspect of society (school, work, etc.) If African Americans really feel that they are less intelligent than whites for example, then they are giving in to the stereotype.We all need to ignore these stereotypes and that is how they will go away.  For some reason people feel the need to bring race into every situation in this world which in all honesty is stupid and absurd.

    I feel as though everyone has to make excuses and cannot accept their own failure.  Instead of arguing that a person does not do well because of discrimination, how about they get up and try again or work harder.  Stop pointing fingers.  Claude M. Steele can do all the research he wants, but I really believe that race has nothing to do with how well a person can perform.  So essentially is it that I could be lazy and get all "C"s in college and then say I felt I could not perform because people were discriminating against me.  I think that is ridiculous.  Academic performance comes from the willingness of someone to learn.  There are numerous situations where the educational system in the United States is struggling due to lack of funding, bad faculty, poverty, etc., but these issues do not apply to just one group of people.  Everyone is effected by these problems.  There are huge issues with inner city schools, but that is a completley different topic.

      At this point in our society, the vast majority of people in this country accept every culture.  I may have gone on a bit of a rant here which I am sorry.  The bottom line and major point I am making here is that everyone is EQUAL and no matter what studies are shown I personally cannot agree with this idea.  I understand completely if people disagree with me and I never aimed to offend anyone, but this is how I feel.  I may have gone in the opposite direction with this blog, but it is exactly these sort of terms and ideas that add fuel to the fire when we are trying to douse the flames of any sort of racial prejudice that still exists.
