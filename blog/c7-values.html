  <p> The values that I hace held close to me throughout my proudest moments in life are achievement, responsibility, helping others, will-power, and commitment.  These are just a few, but I believe they are my strongest ones.  For the most part I try to live by these values everyday, but obviously it does not always happen because I am not perfect.  If I did not have these values though, I would not be standing where I am today.  Out of these five values responsibility means the most to me.  I always take repsonsibility for my actions and I also believe that others can rely on me if needed.  I have shown repsonsibility throughout my life with family, school, work, etc.  I think it is important to have repsonsibility.  Some people do not like the pressure which is normal, but it gives me a sense of satisfaction that I can be trusted.  Also I feel that when I make a mistake owning up to it is far more worthwhile than trying to point blame on someone or something else.  Taking repsonsibility helped me grow and mature and taught me valuable lessons in life.

  One of the things I take pride in is giving advice to others.  I have gone through a lot in my life and can relate well to others.  I like giving advice and I try to help others by doing so.  The last time I gave advice to my friend recently was related to family matters.  He was having some trouble at home and I talked with him for a decent amount of time and at the end we both felt better about the situation. This is just one example of when I gave someone advice.  I have had numerous sitautions like this.  It gives me a good feeling inside because I do genuinely like to help others.  I feel if I can even make one person's day a little easier, I have done something good.
  I feel my values definitely helped me throughout my life and continue to today.  Without them I would not have graduated school or achieved the job I have now.
