    As we have all heard about the huge data breaches in the past year such as Target, Home Depot, and more, millions of people are at risk with their information whether it is personal, credit cards, etc.  Data breaches are on the rise and hackers every year are finding new and improved ways of stealing information that does not belong to them.  Everyone from the average person to big companies to the federal government are at risk especially now that the majority of data out in the world is digital.  Companies and governments have been focusing a lot of time and enrgy into data protection legislation, training, and systems, but will have to do much more to give themselves the best protection.  Unfortunatley, hackers have kept up and done their homework and continue to steal information.  Many time hackers target lower end companies, banks, etc. since their security systems may not be as complex and are easy to breach.

  So what is information security?  It is simply the idea of protecting unauthorized access, use, distribution, manipulation, or destruction of any data whether it is physical or electronic.  Data breaches do not only happen through large hacks, but could simply happen just because someone in the office left their computer on and walked away.  Information security is an increasing issue in the tech world especially since the amount of electronic information is growing at an astronomical pace.

  In order to help solve this large growing problem for starters companies need to make their employees aware of how important protecting data is and what can happen if it falls into the wrong hands.  They should hold seminars or discussions that explain different security measures workers could use such as firewalls, passwords, encryption, and so on.  The government needs to pass more stricter legisation to help protect information better and on top of that improve their own firewalls or systems.  The same goes for large comapnies as well.  When Target got hacked in 2014, 70 million people had their card information stolen which is a huge amount of people. That was just one breach.  It only takes ONE.  People need to do a little bit of research on this subject.  Many times there are simple practices that can be used to make security much better (ex: strong passwords, not abcde or 12345).  Many large security companies have started what they call ethical hacking, which is where they hire someone to try and hack into their own system.  Practices such as these are great because it allows them to see where the system is flawed and where improvements can be made.  Overall, information security will continue to be a hot issue for decades to come and more awareness about it needs to be made public whether by government, media, and people in general.
