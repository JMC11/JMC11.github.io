  <h1>Ruby vs. JavaScript</h1>
  <h4>April 10, 2015</h4>

  <p>
    Ruby and JavaScript may similarities and some same built in methods, but they differ in many ways.  It is not that they are completely different.  The main differences are in the syntax, terminology, and structure of the code.  Now this statement may seem like it it makes these two languages sound completely different, but when you learn one then the other or vice versa, you will find many of the same concepts just coded differently and defined as different terms.  Today I am going to talk about the fundamental differences between Ruby and JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    One main difference between Ruby and JavaScript is the Ruby hash vs. the JavaScript objects.  JavaScript objects are essentially constructed in the same way as a Ruby hash.  They look like the following:
  </p>
    <div class = "center-3">
    <code>
      var athlete = {
      <br>
      name: "Avery Bradley",
      <br>
      team: "Boston Celtics"
      <br>
    };
  </code>
</div>
  <p>
    A Ruby hash looks like this:
  </p>
    <div class = "center-3">
    <code>
      athlete = {
      <br>
      :name => "Avery Bradley",
      <br>
      :team => "Boston Celtics"
      <br>
    }
  </code>
</div>
<p>
  So you can see from these two pieces of code they both store the same information, but are different. For starters almost everything in Ruby are objects.  The name and team symbols in the hash are objects and also know as keys that store the string values to their right.  The JavaScript object is given the properties of name and team that also store the string values to their right.  As you can see a hash is a collection of keys and values and an object is a collection of properties.  Both of these structures can be looped or iterated over in their respected languages and are very useful ways of grouping information into an organized fashion.
</p>
<p>
  Syntax wise you can see that both code sections use a colon.  Ruby places them in front while JavaScript places them behind.  The var keyword in Java tells you that you are delcaring the variable object athlete where ruby just needs the word athlete and the correct brackets to understand it is a hash.  So some people would argue that Ruby has better built in functions than JavaScript.  There is some truth to this, but this is a very small example.  Ruby also uses "=>" to store values to keys and hashes do not have to use a symbol.  The keys can actually be coded as strings in the hash.  So this is just one fundamental difference between Ruby and JavaScript, but there are many more.  If you are interested or just curious you can look into differences with looping, syntax, control flow/structure, etc.
