  <h1>Maintaining my Website</h1>
  <h4>April 20, 2015</h4>

      I have really enjoyed working on my website.  It has been time consuming, but seeing the small improvements I have made over time is rewarding.  Although it is still a simple website, I am happy as to where it currently is.  Being a website with the sole purpose of being a porfolio for companies, I feel it should be rather simple and direct.  Building it from scratch was pretty cool.  There are endless possibilities for what you can do with your own website.

      The hardest part I have faced so far would have to be CSS positioning.  It took me a lot of trial and error, but using the developer tools in Google Chrome was definitely very helpful.  I had to do extra research when it came to positioning, but in the end I came to the conclusion that it will change constantly if you keep up with your website.  The fun parts of this website are adding backgrounds, fonts, colors, etc.  Seeing my own creation come to life made me feel I accomplished something and I know as I go along and learn more tricks and CSS, I can really make it into something spectacular.  I will continue to go back to my site when I have the time and add to it.
