  <h1>CSS Selectors (Class vs ID)</h1>

      Classes are best designated for styles that you plan on using multiple times in yoiur html document.  Ids are mainly designed for styling one specific tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes and ids are called selectors in CSS.  Classes use a "." in front of their name when coded in CSS.  If you were to create the class "header" and you wanted it to give the selected elements a text size of 20 and a color of red you would code:

      <div class="center">
        .header {
          font-size: 20px;
          color: red;
        }
      </div>
      The HTML tag would look like this: "<div class="header"></div>""

      It is important to include the semi-colon in the coding so CSS knows that it ends the statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ids work almost in the same way.  Ids use a "#" in front of their name in CSS.  Lets create the id called "lower" that makes text size 10.  It goes like this:
      <div class="center">
        #lower {
          font-size: 20px;
        }
      </div>
      The HTML looks like this: "<p id="lower">Some text.</p>"
  </p>
    <p>
      Essentially classes and Ids are great ways of styling multiple elements within an html document.  CSS is great for this because your webpage can link to a css file and use the code in there and apply it to tags and elements your webpage.  CSS selectors are just one of the numerous things you can accomplish with CSS and HTML.
