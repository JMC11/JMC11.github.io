  <h1>Thoughts and Expectations for DBC</h1>

      I think that the Dev Bootcamp overall experience is going to be pretty brutal work wise, but at the same alot of fun because everyone is going to be going through the same experience together whether or not some people may be more experienced than others.  It is going to be tough, but the overall knowledge and life change you can gain from what this course teaches is priceless.  The way I see it, it is only six months out your entire life and well worth the experience.

      The fact that the culture of Dev Bootcamp is going to be very welcoming is exciting.  The staff as well as the students know going into this that everyone is going to be coming from a different background or lifestyle.  Everyone will be working closely together for incredibly long days so we all will get to know each other on different levels.  Since everyone is working towards the same overall goal, it will be like being on one giant team for the duration of the time.

     The learning culture seems rapid and intense, but seeing as the instructors are well versed in their field and strongly willing to help, it promotes a very freindly environment.  The weeks will be long, but I think overall rewarding as you continue to learn and better yourself.  I believe that as long as you put the right attitude and best foot forward for Dev Bootcamp, you will find it much more relaxing and you will not get as easily frustrated.  Honestly, I am a little nervous going into this as I expect most of us are even if we do not want to admit it. Much of the material is relatively new to me, but I look forward to taking on and exploring new challenges and meeting new people along the way.
