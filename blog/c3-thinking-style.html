  I think my biggest struggle so far in phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp is just trying to grasp all of the new information and learning put in front of me.  It may have a little to do with my thinking stytle considering I am mainly a concrete sequential thinker.  I like taking things in an orderly fashion and perfecting one task before moving on to another.  I think a good chunk of my struggle comes not just from my thinking style, but also balancing work and homelife with the bootcamp.  In terms of my thinking style though following this sort of unstructured phase 0 conflicts somewhat.

In order to help counter this for starters I will have to be a little more accepting of this style and deal with it which may sound cliche, but that is how the world works.  I also plan to instead of going through everything one by one, I am going to try and learn basics for everything, then repeat that cycle for intermediate level, and finally until I can understand all of them at the same level.  This may be better for me as instead of learning one coding language entirely and then forgetting about it, I will have to keep goin back to it.

  By developing a more abstract thinking styles and combining them with my concrete style, I think my time at DevBootcamp will become much less stressful and somewhat easier.  By having a more growth mindset I can be more willing to take on even more challenges, but actually with excitement.  I will not get bent out of shape if I get stumped.  Rather I will take a breather come back to it and overcome it.  Sometimes my mind tells me to quit, but pressing into my brain a growth mindset I can quickly silence those thoughts.  Overall I plan on becoming a more well-rounded person when it comes to learning.
