  <h1>Test Driven Development</h1>

    Originally started in 2003, test-driven development is a way for developers in programming to find a minimum working solution.  It has a short development cycle that is repeated over and over to keep on improving code and sustaining software. TDD is essentially designing a test, seeing it fail, then writing passable code, running the test again, and refactoring.  So there is pretty much a five step process to the development.  I am going to explain each.
  </p>
  <p>
    First you want to write a test in which fills the qualifications and features of the function or program that is being designed.  User stories are a good way to do this.  Think of looking at your program and saying "As a user I want to ...".  By asking this question you can then answer with the following requirements.  This thought process gives a programmer an idea of what they are making before they code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next a developer will run the tests and watch to see if the new one fails as it should.  The developer has an expected reason why it should fail.  The new test should not pass anything.  If it passes somehow, the code is wrong, not needed, or might already exist.  After seeing their test fail, the programmer must then write code to pass the new test.  This code shouldn be the bare minimum to allow the test to pass.  That is the goal of TDD.  Get a working solution and fix it afterwards.  You want to see your function work and many times it is a continuous work in progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that all the code has been written it is time to run all the tests again.  If they all pass then it is a success and you have a minimum viable product, or simply a program with the bare minimums that works.  If there are any failed tests, the developers will go back and look over all their code again.  Once all the tests have passed and the programmers is confident there are no flaws they will refactor the code.  Refactoring is very important as its purpose is to improve logic and readability of code.  Programmers will look to remove duplicate code, position functions, objects, etc. into logical spots in the program, have their variables be clearly defined, and overall have readable code.
  </p>
  <p>
    So this is essentially the process or cycle of a typical test driven development scenario.  TDD is constantly repeated.  People find it is easier to maintain, improve, and extend.  TDD programs can be built upon and since you are iterating over and over again, you can keep expanding and bettering your end product.  Many companies have transitioned over to TDD and many more continue to adopt its methodology.
