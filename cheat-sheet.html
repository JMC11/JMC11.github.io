  Let's start at the beginning--Version Control benefits. Version control is "controlling" the "version" of the code you are working on. Basically, it allows you to save previous versions of your code, just in case you make a mistake and crash the program. This is one of the benefits of version control. Your previous works are saved and changes are tracked, so that you may always refer back to them and see what was changed to either fix the program or cause it to crash. Another benefit of version control is that it allows you to view what other people change in the programming and when they did it. Let's say "Jim" was working on the project and changed something in the code that caused half of the inputs to not work, but he's out on vacation and you don't know what he changed. Version control allows you to view the recent changes and (pretty much) undo whatever Jim did.

  This is where git comes into play. Git uses version control constantly to help maintain the productiveness of your program. Git registers and stores the time and date of when data was changed, who changed it, and what they had changed. Git also allows you to work on a project with others simultaneously, without stepping on each other's toes. Git creates "branches" (like a tree) which allows different members to test out certain code and not step on each other's toes and overwrite each other's work.
